# Inner-Detection-and-Classification-of-Brain-Tumors-Using-MRI-images
This is a thesis based project for Computer Engineering bachelor's degree.

This project was coded on two platforms using Python as the programming language.

# Steps on how to run the program

  1. Download the dataset and the Inner-Detection-and-Classification-of-Brain-Tumors-Using-MRI-images zipfile
  2. Unzip both files "dataset and Inner-Detection-and-Classification-of-Brain-Tumors-Using-MRI-images"
  3. Add the dataset folder to the Inner-Detection-and-Classification-of-Brain-Tumors-Using-MRI-images folder under Project model folder
  4. Add the dataset folder to the Inner-Detection-and-Classification-of-Brain-Tumors-Using-MRI-images folder under Project model folder
  5. Install the required Python libraries listed on the "requirements.txt" file of the project and some additionals as needed.
  6. copy the file path link of the MRI image of your choice from the test dataset and paste like the example below:

               # Loading the image and mask in grayscale
               mri_image = cv2.imread('dataset/Testing/glioma_tumor/image(9).jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
               mask = cv2.imread('dataset/Testing/glioma_tumor/image(9).jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
   
  7. Run the code with any platform that handles Python language. Preferably Visual Studio Code is recommended if possible and the latest version of Python.

NB: Steps 6 and 7 also apply to the Kaggle version, however on kaggle there is no need of the latest python installation. kaggle provides the latest version since it is an online platform.
